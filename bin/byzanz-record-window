# Best software I ever found to record GIF screencasts is Byzanz.
# 
# Byzanz is great because it records directly to GIF, the quality and FPS is 
# impressive while maintaining the size of the files to a minimal.
# 
# Unfortunately support has been dropped and you can no longer find any 
# packages for Ubuntu that wont break your system and have missing 
# unsatisfiable dependencies.
# 
# Fortunately Debian still maintains the package for Sid and the GIT 
# repository still exists.
# 
# If you want to go ahead and install the .deb file from Sid (works in 
# Ubuntu 11.10, just tested, no warranties!), download it from the Debian 
# packages page and install it with sudo dpkg -i.
# 
# Also, one of our esteemed moderators has ported the Debian package to 
# a PPA making it easier to install, you can add it to your system and 
# install Byzanz by opening a terminal and typing:
# 
# sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fossfreedom/byzanz
# sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install byzanz
# When its installed you can run it in a terminal.
# 
# Byzanz-record --duration=15 --x=200 --y=300 --width=700 --height=400 out.gif
